# LameCode's Auto Typer Lite (LCAT)

Lightweight, portable and completely FREE solution for your auto-typing needs. Free alternative to Murgee's Auto Typer. Very simple to use. Compatible with all Windows versions having .NET 4.8

- Currently, Windows 11 Smart Screen blocks the app because I am unknown developer. Just click "Launch anyway".

## What it can do?
- This will auto type message of any length. You can save up to 10 different messages.
- Works in all applications, even those where you can't copy & paste stuff in.

### What is planned:
- Release a PRO version that will allow you to use 10 macro sets. Usage is for you, but it's meant to be for different apps & games. Set 1 is for let's say one game, Set 2 would be for another game. Because you do not need macros from one game in other, you can easily switch the macro set without having to fiddle in the folder.

## What it CAN'T do?
- Paste anything straight from your clipboard. All macros must be saved in the text file.
- Auto Type things indefinitely
- Schedule Auto Typing
## Installation

At this moment, this application is fully portable. There is no installation required and it can be stored and carried on a thumb drive.
## License

You can use this code, build your projects on top of it or use parts of it in any way, but the resulting app must be OPEN SOURCE and you're never allowed to sell it commercially and accept donations for the final app.
